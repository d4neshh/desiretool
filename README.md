Desire Tool is a simple lightweight downloading tool that allows you to download files from YouTube, Spotify, and Soundcloud.

Downloading directly from Spotify is not allowed and this tool respects that, it instead searches for the same file on YouTube and downloads it from there. 
!!! SPOTIFY DOWNLOADING MAY NOT WORK FOR PODCASTS !!!

SoundCloud downloading may be buggy as some songs may not have permissions required to download the file.
